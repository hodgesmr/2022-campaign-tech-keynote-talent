This repository contains the slides to my morning keynote talk at the [2022 CampaignTech Innovation Summit](https://web.archive.org/web/20221117001518/https://campaigntechsummit.com/agenda/) on November 17, 2022. The talk was titled "Tech Innovation Comes From Those Who Build It" and spoke about the necessity of retaining tech talent in campaign work and why we need to speak more visibly about the interesting and challenging problems we solve.
